# Carbon Calculator (Oak vs Pine)

A simple Python-based calculator that compares a basic carbon index
for oak and pine trees using field measurements such as height and canopy diameter.

## Context
During an environmental field study, our team used an existing Python-based calculator
to compare carbon sequestration potential across species.
After learning Python more formally, I recreated a simplified version of that logic
to better understand the calculations and demonstrate the approach in code.

## How to run
```bash
python3 carbon_calculator.py
```
